# Majestic test

Build task and SASS structure based on my own (work in progress) boilerplate repo:

https://github.com/jimsheen/modular-gulp-js-and-sass-boilerplate

Needs some sort of server to run can either use http-server or npm install and run node server.

I would have preferred to use some sort of templating framework such as knockout or handlebars for this task but I decided to use jQuery to quickly mock up a prototype.

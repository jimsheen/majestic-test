# Majestic test

Based on my own boilerplate repo which can be found here:

https://github.com/jimsheen/modular-gulp-js-and-sass-boilerplate

I have built the add comment functionality using JavaScript and jQuery however, I would have preferred to use some sort of templating framework such as knockout or handlebars for this task.
